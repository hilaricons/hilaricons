## build
to build, simply get these prerequisites:

1. node + npm (as always)
2. a convertio api key (for ttf conversion)
3. `npm i` to get the deps
4. a positive™ fucking™ attitude™ (the build script doesnt work for non good spirited ppl for now (i think))

then just run the `build.js` file.
keep in mind all config is stored in the `build.js` file, including whether to build a ttf or an svg

## usage
