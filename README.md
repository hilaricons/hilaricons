hilaricons is a specil icon set bcuz uhh

- funny logo
- we have a gradient + venn rgb diagram icon
- why not

we hope that you can use hilaricons within ur next projectery.

## build
to build, simply get these prerequisites:

1. node + npm (as always)
2. a convertio api key (for ttf conversion)
3. `npm i` to get the deps
4. a positive™ fucking™ attitude™ (the build script doesnt work for non good spirited ppl for now (i think))

then just run the `build.js` file.
keep in mind all config is stored in the `build.js` file, including whether to build a ttf or an svg

## usage
for now we don't have any solid way to use hilaricons but we are working for a solution, trust us.
